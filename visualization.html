    <h2> Data Visualization </h2>
    <h3> What is Data Visualization? </h3>
      <p>Data visualization is the practice of turning raw data into charts, graphs, or other visuals so it is easier to understand. Instead of reading through long tables or numbers, visuals help you quickly notice patterns, trends, and changes. It’s an important part of machine learning because it gives you a clearer picture of your data before building any models.</p>

    <h4> Common Types of Visualizations </h4>
      <p>Different visualizations are used to highlight different parts of a dataset, and each type of chart has its own purpose. Some visuals make it easier to spot trends, while others help compare groups or understand how values are spread out. Picking the right chart helps you interpret data more clearly and communicate your findings better.</p>
      <ul class = "classification-list">
        <li> Line Plot : Shows how values change over time by connecting data points with a line. It is useful for tracking trends, patterns, or changes such as temperature over days or sales across months.</li>

        <li> Bar Chart : Compares different categories or groups using rectangular bars. It helps visualize differences between groups, like comparing the popularity of products, countries, or age ranges.</li>

        <li> Scatter PLot : Displays individual data points on a graph to show the relationship between two variables. It is often used to see whether variables are correlated, like study time vs. test scores.</li>

        <li> Histogram : Shows how data is distributed by grouping values into bins and displaying how often each range appears. It is helpful for seeing patterns such as skewed data, clusters, or whether values are evenly spread.</li>

        <li> Pie Chart : Represents parts of a whole by dividing a circle into slices. It is commonly used for showing percentages, such as how different categories contribute to a total.</li>

        <li> Box PLot : Summarizes the spread of data using quartiles and highlights the median, lower and upper ranges, and any outliers. This chart is useful for seeing the overall distribution and spotting unusual values.</li>

    <h3> Why Visuals Matter in Data Analysis </h3>
        <p> Visualization helps you understand your data long before you build a model. When you turn your data into charts, you can quickly see patterns, relationships, unusual values, and overall structure. This makes it easier to choose the right features, select an appropriate model, and understand what your dataset actually represents. After training, visualization helps you evaluate your results, such as checking how well a regression line fits or how clearly different groups were separated. It provides a clearer picture of model performance and makes the entire machine learning process easier to understand. </p>
    <h4> Raw Data to Visual Insight </h4>
      <p> The visualization workflow begins with loading and cleaning your dataset. Once everything is prepared, you choose a chart that matches what you want to explore, such as a scatter plot for relationships or a histogram for distributions. After creating the visual, you study the chart to see trends, outliers, or interesting patterns. These observations guide your next steps, helping you understand your data better and make more informed decisions throughout your machine learning process.</p>
