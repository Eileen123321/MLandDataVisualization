    Hi everyone! When I first started learning machine learning, I always found it hard to find open-access websites that explained the concepts in a way that actually made sense. Most of the resources I came across were either too advanced, skipped steps, or expected you to already know the basics. That’s why I decided to create this site, a simple, beginner-friendly space where anyone can learn machine learning and data visualization at their own pace, with clear examples and visual explanations.
    </p>

    <p> On this site, you'll find may simple explanations of machine learning basics like regression, classification, and clustering, along with simple visuals and examples to help bring each idea to life. Everything is organized in a way that lets beginners build a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced topics. </p>
  
    <p>I plan to continue expanding this site in the future by adding more topics, improving the explanations, and including more interactive examples. My goal is to keep making this space better so learning machine learning feels more approachable for everyone.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>What chart should I use for my data?</summary>
  <p>It depends on what you want to explore. Use a scatter plot for relationships, a bar chart for categories, a histogram for distributions, and a line plot for changes over time.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>Do I need coding experience to create visualizations?</summary>
  <p>Basic Python helps, but many visualization concepts can be understood without coding.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>What’s the difference between a histogram and a bar chart?</summary>
  <p>A histogram shows how data is distributed across ranges, while a bar chart compares categories or groups.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>How does visualization help improve my machine learning model?</summary>
  <p>It helps you see relationships, spot outliers, and understand how your model performs after training.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>What is the best way to start learning visualization?</summary>
  <p>Start with simple charts like line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to build a solid foundation.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>Can visualizations show if my data has errors?</summary>
  <p>Yes. Charts can reveal missing values, unusual spikes, or strange patterns that may signal issues.</p>
</details>

<details class="faqbox">
  <summary>Do all machine learning projects need visualization?</summary>
  <p>Most projects benefit from visualization because it helps you understand your data and communicate results.</p>
